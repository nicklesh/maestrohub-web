<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to convert a React Native/Expo application from a GitHub repository into a pure React web application.
The final web app should be deployed with the custom domain .
The user explicitly requested not to use Expo.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Framework**: Pure React.
2.  **Deployment**: Through the Emergent webapp deployment service.
3.  **Authentication**: Use the existing custom JWT-based authentication.
4.  **Parity**: The features, theme, and overall user experience of the web app must be identical to the original native application.
5.  **Backend**: Reuse the existing backend APIs and integrations from the provided codebase.
6.  **Roles**: The application must support all features for three distinct user roles: Consumer/Parent, Tutor, and Admin.
7.  **UI/UX**: Replicate the mobile UI, including a bottom navigation bar for authenticated users, and ensure all pages and components match the mobile reference.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A partially converted React web application. The initial React Native codebase was cloned, and a new pure React frontend was scaffolded. The existing FastAPI backend was moved and is running successfully.

The new React app includes:
- A complete project structure with necessary dependencies installed.
- Contexts for Auth, Theme, Toast, and i18n.
- A significant number of pages created for all three user roles (Consumer, Tutor, Admin).
- A  component that mimics the mobile app's footer navigation.
- A comprehensive translation file ().

**Last working item**:
The agent was systematically addressing a detailed list of bugs and missing features reported by the user.

- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was rewriting the Account/Profile page to match the mobile application's design and functionality. It had just finished overwriting  based on the original React Native component's code. The corresponding CSS has not been updated, and the functionality has not been tested.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** both
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
This list is based on the user's last detailed feedback message. The agent was actively working on these when the session ended.

-   **Issue 1:** The Account page () is functionally incomplete and needs to replicate the mobile version. (P0 - HIGHEST)
-   **Issue 2:** The bottom navigation footer is missing the My Kids link and doesn't display correctly on desktop browsers. (P1)
-   **Issue 3:** On the Find a Coach (Search) page, coach cards are missing several data points (Country Flag, price, category pills), and the search box placeholder is not translated. (P1)
-   **Issue 4:** The Coach Details page throws an error on load, likely due to missing translations. (P1)
-   **Issue 5:** The Bookings page has untranslated tab labels and is missing the Rescheduled tab. The empty state messages are also not translated. (P1)

    -   **P1: Final Codebase Audit**: Perform a final audit comparing the web app's page structure and features against the original React Native codebase to catch any remaining discrepancies.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Deployment**: Deploy the final, tested web application to the user's custom domain  using the Emergent deployment service.

**Completed work in this session**
- **React Native to Pure React Conversion (Initial):**
    - Cloned the original GitHub repository.
    - Set up a new pure React frontend project structure.
    - Copied and configured the existing FastAPI backend.
- **Page and Component Creation:**
    - Created placeholder pages and CSS for all three roles (Admin, Consumer, Tutor).
    - Implemented a  component to serve as the footer, based on user-provided images.
- **Initial Bug Fixes & Feature Additions:**
    - Added a large number of missing pages that were identified after the first user review.
    - Updated  with routes for all new pages.
    - Added the bottom navigation bar to all authenticated pages.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Context API for state management.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Python.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (configured via  in ).
-   **Architecture**: Monorepo-style structure with separate  and  directories. The conversion involves replacing React Native components with web-standard equivalents (e.g.,  -> ,  -> ).

**key DB schema**
The database schema is implicitly defined by the backend API and models. The agent has not directly interacted with or modified the schema. It is using the existing backend as-is.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The primary change is the frontend technology stack, moving from **React Native/Expo** to **pure React** for the web.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.js**: Just overwritten to match mobile functionality. Needs CSS and testing.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/SearchPage.js**: Rewritten to add more data to coach cards. Needs testing.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/BookingsPage.js**: Edited to add a tab and fix translations. Needs testing.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BottomNav.js**: Edited to add a link and fix display issues. Needs testing.
-   **/app/frontend/src/i18n/locales/en_US.json**: Modified multiple times to add missing translation keys for various pages.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Contains all the client-side routing logic for the application.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/ProfilePage.css**: This file is now out of sync with its corresponding JS file () which was completely rewritten. It needs to be updated or rewritten to style the new component structure.
-   Many CSS files were created as empty placeholders alongside their JS page components. While some have been populated, a general review for consistent styling and cleanup might be beneficial later.

**key api endpoints**
-   The agent is reusing the backend as-is. All API endpoints are prefixed with  and are defined in . The frontend interacts with them via an Axios instance configured with .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   You are in the middle of a large bug-fixing session. Do not start new tasks. Your priority is to validate all the recent code changes made to address the user's last feedback.
-   Start by updating the CSS for the rewritten  located at .
-   After updating the CSS, restart the services and test every single item from the All Pending/In progress Issue list to ensure the fixes work as intended.
-   The user expects a high degree of fidelity with the original mobile app. Use the code in  as the source of truth for functionality and UI layout.
-   After verifying all fixes, use the testing agent for a full regression test before reporting back to the user.
