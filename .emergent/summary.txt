**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application foundation has been successfully built for the Acharyaly app.

- **Backend (FastAPI):** A  file has been created containing a complete set of API endpoints for authentication (register, login), user management, tutor profiles, search, and configuration metadata. It includes Pydantic models for all data structures (User, Tutor, Student, Booking) and connects to MongoDB. Integrations for Stripe and Resend are included, but currently use placeholder keys.

- **Frontend (Expo):** A comprehensive file-based routing structure is in place using Expo Router, with dedicated layouts and screens for , , , and  roles. Core logic for authentication (), global state management (), and API communication () is implemented in the  directory. The UI for login, registration, consumer home, and search screens has been built. A responsive design system has been initiated and applied to these key screens.

- **Backend API:** Built the entire  with FastAPI, defining all MVP models and CRUD/auth endpoints.
- **Frontend Architecture:** Established a robust file-based routing system with Expo Router for all user roles.
- **Core Frontend Logic:** Created  for authentication state,  for global state with Zustand, and  for backend communication.
- **UI Implementation:** Developed the primary user-facing screens: Login, Register, Consumer Home, and Search.
- **Responsive Design Foundation:** Created responsive utilities in  and  and applied them to the auth and main consumer screens.
- **Initial Testing:** Verified backend endpoints with  and visually inspected the frontend UI with the  tool.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The only major issue encountered was a path resolution error for imports, which was successfully fixed by consistently using the  alias.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None. This is the first development session.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI (backend), React Native with Expo (frontend).
- **Database:** MongoDB (accessed asynchronously with ).
- **State Management:** Zustand for global state, React Context for authentication.
- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based).
- **Styling:** , with a custom utility for responsive design.
- **API Communication:** .
- **Authentication:** JWT-based token system.

**All files of reference**
- **Backend:**  (The entire backend logic).
- **Frontend Core:**
    -  (Root navigator, manages auth state).
    -  (Handles user session and auth logic).
    -  (Zustand store for global state).
    -  (Core logic for responsive design).
    -  (Hook for using responsive styles in components).
- **Updated Screens:**

    - 
    - 
    - 
- **Documentation:** 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The agent rewrote entire screen files (, , etc.) to add responsive design. While effective, a more sustainable approach would be to break down these screens into smaller, reusable responsive components. The next agent should consider this when modifying or creating new screens.

**key api endpoints**
- 
- 
-

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The project is named **Acharyaly**.
- **Stripe** and **Resend** integrations are using placeholder keys. Do not ask the user for real keys until you are working on a task that explicitly requires them.
- A responsive design system has been initiated (). Continue to use and expand upon this for all UI work to maintain consistency.
- The next immediate task is to finish applying the responsive design to all remaining screens as detailed in the In progress Task List.
- A user requirement to track **Device ID** was acknowledged but has not been implemented yet. This is a pending task.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **User (Message 83):** Requested responsive design for tablets and desktops. (IN PROGRESS)
2. **User (Message 14):** Gave the command to build. (COMPLETED)
3. **User (Message 12):** Provided app name (Acharyaly), taglines, and a color theme. (COMPLETED)
4. **User (Message 10):** Confirmed Resend for emails and asked for a readiness check. (COMPLETED)
5. **User (Message 8):** Answered initial dependency questions: use placeholders for Stripe/email keys, use free push notifications, use both auth options, build the full MVP, and added a requirement to capture Device ID. (PARTIALLY COMPLETED - Device ID not yet implemented)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:**
    - Stripe payment functionality.
    - Resend email functionality.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Stripe (Payments)** — requires User API Key (currently using placeholders).
- **Resend (Email)** — requires User API Key (currently using placeholders).
- **Emergent Google OAuth** — uses Emergent LLM Key.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No specific credentials were saved. A new test user can be created via the  endpoint.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- **Device ID Tracking:** The user explicitly requested to Make sure the Device ID is captured with the profile so devices can be tied to user account in Message 8. The agent acknowledged this in Message 9 but did not implement it in the backend models in  or add the corresponding frontend logic to capture and send the device information. This remains an outstanding task from the initial requirements.
